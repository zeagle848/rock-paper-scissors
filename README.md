## Introduction

This rock-paper-scissors application was developed as an assignment in the open-source web development course known as The Oding Project (TOP). The link to the assignment page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). 

## Getting Started

Before we can start the live server we must first make sure that Node.js is installed. Check by opening your console and running `node -v`. If you can't see a version number you must install Node.js. 

To view the app locally you can begin by installing the dependencies...

`npm install`

...and then start by running:

`npm run serve`.

The application should be live on `http://localhost:8080/` if it doesn't open automatically.
